### 🏁 Conclusion

The analysis of the toy manufacturing industry from **2005 to 2016** reveals a sector that underwent significant transformation. After reaching a historical peak in **2005**, the industry faced a prolonged period of decline that lasted nearly a decade. However, the data indicates a resilient shift toward **stabilization starting in 2013**. 

Key findings highlight that the industry is not geographically uniform; rather, it is anchored by powerhouse states like **California**, suggesting that infrastructure, supply chains, and labor markets for toy craft are highly specialized and concentrated. This project successfully bridges backend data management with interactive frontend visualization, providing a clear roadmap of where the industry has been and its current steady state.
